## Welcome to Dustin Rogers' GitHub Portfolio
[Resume](https://dustinrogers.github.io/Resume/)

This page contains a number of independent projects that I have worked on over the past few months. I have sub-divided the projects into multiple categories based on whether it was from a consulting project vs. something that I choose to work on independently (i.e. I found the problem or subject interesting). If you have any questions you can reach me at <rogers.dustin@gmail.com>. I hope you enjoy!
