Hey, I am Dustin Rogers. I have worked in corporate finance for the past 6 years after getting my Masters degree in Economics; however, I enjoy teaching myself data science and programming in R and Python. This page contains a number of independent projects that I have worked on over the past few months. I have sub-divided the projects into multiple categories based on whether it was from a consulting project vs. something that I choose to work on independently. Please feel free to contact me at <rogers.dustin@gmail.com>. Thanks for looking!
