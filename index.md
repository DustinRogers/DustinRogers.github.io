## Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  

[Resume](https://dustinrogers.github.io/online-resume/) 

Hi, my name is Dustin Rogers and thanks for looking at my  data analysis portfolio! I am originally from South Carolina, but currently I am traveling with my girlfriend and dog across the US in our 2005 Sprinter van. As of October 2019, we are based in Portland, Oregon where I am working remotely as a Data Science Consultant. Prior to this trip, I received my Masters in Economics at the University of South Carolina in 2012. In the 7 years since graduation, I have transitioned from working as a research analyst in the Economics department to a career as a data and financial consultant for 2 supplemental health and life insurance companies. Along side my professional work I have also enjoyed teaching myself data science and programming in R and Python as well as completing the first CFA exam. My portfolio represents a number of projects that I have worked on over the past year outside of my day job as I try to learn more about data science and statistics. I have divided the projects into 2 categories based on whether it was from a paid consulting project or a project that I choose to work on independently. Please feel free to contact me at <rogers.dustin@gmail.com> with any comments or inquiries.
